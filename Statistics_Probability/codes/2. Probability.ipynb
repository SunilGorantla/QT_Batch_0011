    "Probability denotes the happening of a certain event, and the occurrence of that event, based on past experiences. The probability is the ratio of favorable events to the total number of equally likely events.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "P(A) = \\frac{\\text{number of outcomes where A occurs}}{\\text{number of possible outcomes}}\n",

    "1. **Random Experiment or Trial**: It refers to an action or an operation which can produce any result or outcome.\n",
    "2. **Event**: Event is any possible outcome of a random experiment.\n",
    "3. **Sample space**: The set of all possible outcomes of an experiment is called sample space. For example, when we roll a die, the possible outcomes are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6.\n",
    "4. **Mutually exclusive events or cases**: The occurrence of which prevents the possibility of the other to occur. For example, if a coin is tossed, either the head can be up or tail can be up, but both cannot be up at the same time.\n",
    "5. **Equally likely events**: Two or more events are said to be equally likely if the chance of their happening is equal. For example, the head and tail are equally likely events in tossing an unbiased coin.\n",
    "6. **Exhaustive events**: Exhaustive events refer to the total number of possible outcomes of a random experiment. For example, tossing a coin, the possible outcome is head or tail, exhaustive events are two.\n",
    "7. **Independent Events**: A set of events is said to be independent if the occurrence of an outcome of them does not affect the occurrence of any other outcome in the set.\n",
    "Dependent Events: Dependent events are those the occurrence of one event affects the happening of the other events.\n",
    "8. **Favorable Cases**: The number of outcomes which result in the happening of the desired event is called favorable cases to the event. For example, in a single throw of dice, the number of favorable cases of getting an odd number are three -1, 3 and 5."
