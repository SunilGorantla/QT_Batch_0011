    "1. Paths: A path in a graph is a finite or infinite set of edges which joins a set of vertices. It can connect to 2 or more nodes. Also, if the path connects all the nodes of a graph in Data Structure, then it is a connected graph, otherwise it is called a disconnected graph. There may or may not be path to each and every node of graph. In case, there is no path to any node, then that node becomes an isolated node.<br>\n",
    "<img src=\"Images/graph_path.png\" width=200 height=200>\n",

    "2. Closed Path: A path is called as closed path if the initial node is same as terminal(end) node. A path will be closed path if the starting node is the last node.<br>\n",
    "<img src=\"Images/closed_path.png\" width=200 height=200>\n",
    "3. Simple Path: A path that does not repeat any nodes(vertices) is called a simple path. <br>\n",
    "<img src=\"Images/simple path.png\" width=200 height=200>\n",
    "4. Degree: of a node is the number of edges connecting the node in the graph. A simple example would be, suppose in facebook, if you have 100 friends then the node that represents you has a degree of 100.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Complete Graph: In a complete graph, there is an edge between every single pair of node in the graph. Here, every vertex has an edge to all other vertices. It is also known as a full graph.<br>\n",
    "<img src=\"Images/connected graph.png\" width=200 height=200>\n",
