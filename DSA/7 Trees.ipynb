    "# Tree Data Structure\n",
    "A tree is a widely used data structure in computer science that simulates a hierarchical tree structure with a set of connected nodes. Here's a detailed breakdown of a tree data structure:\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"Images/tree.png\" >\n",
    "\n",
    "Key Components\n",
    "1. **Node**: Each element in the tree is called a node.\n",
    "\n",
    "    - **Root Node**: The top node of the tree. It has no parent.\n",
    "    - **Child Node**: A node that is a descendant of another node.\n",
    "    - **Parent Node**: A node that has one or more child nodes.\n",
    "    - **Leaf Node**: A node that has no children. It is also known as a terminal node.\n",
    "    - **Internal Node**: A node that has at least one child.\n",
    "    - **Sibling Nodes**: Nodes that share the same parent.\n",
    "    - **Edge**: The connection between two nodes. It can be thought of as a link or pointer from one node to another.\n",
    "2. **Subtree**: Any node and all its descendants form a subtree.\n",
    "3. **Path**: A sequence of nodes and edges connecting a node with a descendant.\n",
    "4. **Depth**: The number of edges from the root to the node.\n",
    "5. **Height**: The number of edges on the longest path from the node to a leaf.\n",
    "6. **Level**: The level of a node is defined by how many connections it is away from the root node.\n",
    "7. **Degree**: The number of children a node has.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Properties of Trees\n",
    "- Trees are acyclic: They do not contain cycles.\n",
    "- Trees are connected: There is a path between any two nodes.\n",
    "- Trees have a hierarchical structure.\n",
    "## Types of Trees\n",
    "- **Binary Tree**: Each node has at most two children, typically referred to as the left child and the right child.\n",
    "- **Binary Search Tree (BST)**: A binary tree where the left child of a node contains only nodes with values less than the parent node, and the right child contains only nodes with values greater than the parent node.\n",
    "- **AVL Tree**: A self-balancing binary search tree where the difference in heights between the left and right subtrees of any node is no more than one.\n",
    "- **Red-Black Tree**: A self-balancing binary search tree where each node has an extra bit for denoting the color of the node, either red or black, to ensure the tree remains balanced during insertions and deletions.\n",
    "- **B-Tree**: A self-balancing tree data structure that maintains sorted data and allows for efficient insertion, deletion, and search operations. It is commonly used in databases and file systems.\n",
    "- **Heap**: A special tree-based data structure that satisfies the heap property. A min-heap has the smallest element at the root, while a max-heap has the largest element at the root.\n",
    "- **Trie**: A tree-like data structure used for storing a dynamic set or associative array where the keys are usually strings.\n",
    "## Applications of Trees\n",
    "- **Hierarchical Data Representation**: Such as file systems, organization charts, and taxonomies.\n",
    "- **Binary Search Trees (BST)**: Used in databases and file systems to provide efficient search, insert, and delete operations.\n",
    "- **Heaps**: Used in priority queues, graph algorithms like Dijkstra's shortest path algorithm, and heap sort.\n",
    "- **Tries**: Used in auto-completion, spell checkers, and IP routing.\n",
    "\n",
    "Trees are fundamental in many algorithms and data structures due to their efficiency in organizing hierarchical data and optimizing search operations.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Not trees\n",
    "The following are not trees\n",
