Chess Game Analysis and Model Development
Overview
This project involves analyzing chess game data provided in JSON format to explore patterns, perform necessary data transformations, and build predictive models. The primary goal is to fit Decision Tree and Random Forest algorithms to predict the outcome of chess games, with the target being a win, loss, or draw. We aim to achieve an accuracy above 50% and will also explore the concept of the ELO score, which plays a crucial role in determining player strength.

Project Agenda
Data Loading

Read all JSON files from the train and test folders.
Combine the data into a single dataset for analysis.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Inspect the dataset to understand its structure and contents.
Identify missing values, outliers, and perform initial data visualizations.
Explore the distribution of key features, including player ELO scores, game duration, and move sequences.
Analyze the correlation between features and the outcome of the games.
Data Transformation

Handle missing data and outliers appropriately.
Create new features based on existing data (e.g., difference in ELO scores between players).
Encode categorical variables for model compatibility.
Normalize or scale data as needed for model fitting.
Modeling

Decision Tree

Fit a Decision Tree classifier to the dataset.
Tune hyperparameters to improve model performance.
Evaluate the model using cross-validation and accuracy metrics.
Random Forest

Fit a Random Forest classifier to the dataset.
Perform hyperparameter tuning to enhance accuracy.
Compare the performance with the Decision Tree model.
ELO Score Exploration

Research and document what the ELO score represents in chess.
Analyze how the ELO score impacts the prediction of game outcomes.
Experiment with different ways to incorporate the ELO score into the models to improve accuracy.
Presentation

Create a comprehensive presentation summarizing the findings.
Include key insights from the EDA, data transformations, and modeling phases.
Highlight the performance of the models and the impact of ELO scores.
Discuss potential areas for future improvement.
