    "## Question 1: Iterative line fitting by Distance Minimization\n",
    "\n",
    "### Back Ground\n",
    "Fitting a line to a set of points is a fundamental problem in data science and machine learning. Unlike the least sqaure method which minimizes the sum of distances. This problem focuses on minimizing the sum of perpendicular distance between points and line. This requires iteratively adjusting the line's slops and bias values.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Objective:\n",
    "Create two classs named 'LineModel' and 'OptimizeLineModel'\n",
    "\n",
    "* 'LineModel': creates a default line and stores points as attributes.\n",
    "* 'OptimizeLineModel': Inherits from 'LineModel' and as additional functionality to improve the line's slops and bias values to minimize the distance between points and line.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Scoring criteria:\n",
    "1. Correctness: successfully implementation without any errors: 30 points\n",
    "2. Edge Cases: Identification of edge cases and handling them: 10 points\n",
    "3. Coding style: Following a single coding style: 5 points\n",
    "4. Comments: Adding appropriate comments: 5 points"

    "A nutrition research group is trying to understand impact of different diet plans on weight loss and collected sample data from a group of participants with two different diet plans.  The study included participants were randomly picked and they either follow diet 1 or diet 2. After 12 weeks of close monitoring the weight loss of each participant is recorded. The researchers want to determine if there is a significant difference in the mean weight loss between the two groups. <br>\n",

    "2. Design a hypothesis test on diet 1 group that there is a significant weight loss. Give an explanation if you can/cannot reject the hypothesis test and why. (20 Points)\n",
